\chapter{FDI terminology}

Samsung, headquartered in South Korea, opened a factory in Vietnam called
Samsung Electronics Vietnam.

In this scenario, Samsung Korea is the \textit{parent company}, and Samsung Electronics Vietnam is the
\textit{subsidiary}, also the \textit{(foreign) affiliate}. Empirically, the parent company and the
subsidiary are two distinct entities (i.e. having a different number of
employees, revenue size, profitability, etc.) Theoretically, they negotiate with
and are evaluated by Vietnam as one entity. Therefore, in theoretical
discussion, I refer to Samsung Korea and Samsung Electronics Vietnam jointly as
the \textit{MNC}.

South Korea is the \textit{home country}, and Vietnam is the \textit{host
  country} or the \textit{local country}. I thus refer to Vietnam's economy and firms as the local economy and local firms.
