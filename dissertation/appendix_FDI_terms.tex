\chapter{FDI terminology}

Samsung, headquartered in South Korea, opened a factory in Vietnam called
Samsung Electronics Vietnam in 2009.

In this scenario, Samsung Korea is the \textit{parent company}. Samsung
Electronics Vietnam is the \textit{(foreign) subsidiary}, also the
\textit{(foreign) affiliate}. Empirically, the parent company and the subsidiary
are two distinct entities, having a different number of employees, revenue size,
profitability, etc. Theoretically, they negotiate with and are evaluated by
Vietnam as one entity. Therefore, in theoretical discussion, I refer to Samsung
Korea and Samsung Electronics Vietnam jointly as the \textit{MNC}.

South Korea is the \textit{home country}, and Vietnam is the \textit{host
  country} or the \textit{local country}. I thus refer to Vietnam's economy,
market, and firms as the local economy, local market, and local firms.
