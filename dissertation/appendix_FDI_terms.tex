\chapter{FDI terminology}

Samsung, headquartered in South Korea, opened a factory in Vietnam called
Samsung Electronics Vietnam.

Samsung Korea is the parent company, while Samsung Electronics Vietnam is the
subsidiary or the affiliate. Empirically I distinguish these two entities as they
have their own operational statistics. Theoretically I consider them negotiating
with and being evaluated by the government as one entity.

South Korea is the home country, Vietnam is the host country. I also refer to
Vietnam's economy and firms as the local economy and local firms.
