I would like to thank my two advisors, Professor Edmund Malesky and Professor Michael Ward. Professor Malesky's work on Foreign Direct Investment and the political economy of Vietnam was a big inspiration and the reason for my pursuing a PhD in the first place. He has taught me many lessons in designing research, communicating results, and, most importantly, being a good person. Professor Ward's approach to empirical work was an eye-opener, pushing me to grow in ways I could not envision before. He nurtured Ward lab, a community of smart and supportive people that I benefit from tremendously even to this day. I used to tell every prospective students about the Ward lab, and I really wish I still could.  

I also benefited tremendously from the advice of Professor Peter Hoff and Professor Daniel Stegmueller. Without your kind and patient help, I would not have been able to develop and implement the statistical model for this dissertation. Professor Hoff's ``A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods'' is worth its weight in gold.

My thanks also to Professor Michael Newton for discussing two-sided matching model with me out of nothing but generosity, Professor John Allen Logan for sharing his US labor data, and Professor Andrew Delios for sharing his Japanese Foreign Direct Investment data.

Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Huyen Le, for being there. (She did a lot more, but being there was already enough.)
