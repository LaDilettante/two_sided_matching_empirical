Prior to 1986, FDI in China was limited to few experimental Special Economic Zones, and thus not mentioned in US Investment Reports. The sharp spike in 1988 also does not seem to correspond to any actual change in policy, and likely another artifact of reporting. (See \citet {Zebregs2002} for a historical overview of China's FDI policy.)}}{30}{figure.4.1}
