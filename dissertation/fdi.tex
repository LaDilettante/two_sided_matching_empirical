\chapter{Two-sided matching model on Japanese FDI}
\label{chap:FDI}

In this chapter, I apply the two-sided matching model to analyze Japanese FDI (JFDI) in
Asia. In doing so, I demonstrate how the two-sided matching model can address
the three issues in the current FDI literature. First, I estimate
countries' varying demand for FDI. Second, I show how countries value
different characteristics in a subsidiary. Third, I use firm-level operational data that
maps closer to our theoretical concept of FDI than FDI flow statistics.

This chapter proceeds as follows. Section~\ref{sec:Japan_FDI_in_Asia} motivates
the study of JFDI in Asia. Section~\ref{sec:countries_preference}
qualitatively describes the FDI preference of three Southeast Asian high growth
economies, namely Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.
Section~\ref{sec:Japan_sample} describes the dataset.
Section~\ref{sec:Japan_variables} justifies the variables used in the model.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:Japan_result} discusses the result.

\section{The role of JFDI in Asia}
\label{sec:Japan_FDI_in_Asia}

In the 1980s and 1990s, JFDI began to surge, becoming the second largest
source of FDI, trailing only the US. An important factor behind
this development is the decision to float the hitherto undervalued yen. As the yen began
to rise in the 1980s and peak in 1995 against the dollar,
Japanese companies invested heavily abroad since they now could buy foreign assets
for cheap \citep{Delios2001}.

During this period, JFD also shifted its focus away from North America and
Europe, making Asia its top destination. This new wave of JFDI also had
a different goal. While Japanese MNCs in North America and Europe was motivated
by market expansion or trade barriers avoidance, JFDI in Asia mainly aimed to
take advantage of low labor cost, countering Japan's own rising cost of
production \citep[44]{Jomo1997}.

Scholars have argued that this wave of JFDI was instrumental to Asia's
economic growth by bringing not just capital but also technological know-how and
the opportunity to become integrated in the global production network. In this
so-called ``flying geese'' model of economic development, industrial development
spread from Japan, the leading goose, to the rest of Asia, e.g. the Four Asian
Tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan), ASEAN, and China, etc.
\citep{Bernard1995, Kojima2000}.

\section{Southeast Asian countries' preference for FDI}
\label{sec:countries_preference}

In Chapter~\ref{chap:literature_issues}, I discussed the FDI openness and
targeting strategies of Korea and Taiwan, showing their selectiveness towards
FDI entry. Pursuing a development strategy based on national ownership,
especially after their initial years of economic hardship, Korea and Taiwan only
allowed FDI projects that either 1) contributed to the balance of payments via
export or 2) were willing to transfer advanced technologies to domestic
partners. In this section, I describe the FDI openness and targeting strategies
of the three Southeast Asian newly industrializing economies (NIEs), including
Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, focusing on their preference for
export-oriented and high-tech FDI. Compared to Korea and Taiwan, the Southeast
Asian NIEs did not aggressively pursue a national ownership development
strategy. Therefore, their industrial policy with regards to FDI aimed not to
build up their domestic infant industries but to integrate fully into the MNCs
global production value chain. In general, this strategy meant attracting
export-oriented FDI that performed low-cost assembly then re-exported the
product. In the 1990s, facing rising labor costs and stagnating productivity
from the FDI sector, some countries, especially Malaysia and Thailand, attempted
to move up the global value chain by attracting higher value added FDI, albeit
with varying degrees of success.\footnote{This section relies on a series of
  books edited by Jomo K. S. on Southeast Asia's industrial policy, including
  \citet{Jomo1997, Jomo2001, Jomo2003}.}

\textit{Malaysia}. Initially, FDI flowed into Malaysia largely because of its
import substitution incentives program, launched in 1958. However, as the
domestic market reached its consumption capacity in the late 1960s, Malaysia
pivoted its incentive program to promote export-oriented manufacturing. Malaysia
set up ten Free Trade Zones (FTZs) that were well suited for companies
participating in the global value chains, providing services such as expedited
customs processing and reduced import and export taxes. The Promotion of
Investments Act in 1986 generalized the benefits enjoyed by exporters in the
FTZs to the entire economies, thus fully committed Malaysia to an export-led
growth strategy \citep[96-100]{Jomo2003}.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Malaysia focused on job creation and did not screen FDI
for their technological content. However, in the 1980s and especially the 1990s,
Malaysia became more pro-active in targeting high-tech FDI. Starting with the
1986 Promotion of Investments Act, the government attempted to offered tax
incentives for firms' R\&D activities, albeit with little effect since MNCs
already enjoyed broad and generous exemptions. In 1991, Malaysia phased out full
tax exemption that was available to almost all exporting firms, now exempting
only 60\% instead of 100\% of corporate profits. By doing so, the government
could use full exemption to attract more technologically advanced FDI. In 1995,
the government fully reformed their investment promotion and included a special
incentive program for ``high-technology'' and ``strategic'' FDI projects, namely
those that had at least \$21,500 of capital per employee, 30\% value added, 15\%
of employees in managerial or technical positions, or were located in outlying
states \citep{Felker2001}.

\textit{Thailand}. Like Malaysia, Thailand pursued an import substitution
program that ran out of steam in the 1980s, prompting the government to reform
the economy towards export-led growth. However, unlike Malaysia, Thailand had
developed a larger class of domestic business over two decades of import
substitutions, who now resisted the government's attempt to remove protectionist
measures. Unable to garner inter-ministerial support for domestic reform, Prime
Minister Prem, who had full control of investment promotion via the Board of
Investment (BOI), used incentives to attract export-oriented FDI instead. In the early
the 1990s, the Anand administration (1991-92), which rose to power through a
military coup and was thus relatively insulated from the pressure of domestic
business groups, further removed protectionist policies and pushed for
export-oriented FDI \citep{Felker2001}.

On the other hand, Thailand was less targeted with attracting high-tech FDI.
Indeed, as a BOI Secretary-General complained in 1999, the political influence
of domestic business caused the incentive programs to be used indiscriminately,
even in sectors that suffered from over-capacity \citep[90]{Felker2003}.

\textit{Indonesia} Compared to Malaysia and Thailand, Indonesia attitude towards
FDI was less consistent, swinging between indifference and welcome depending on
the temporary need of the state. After Suharto's rose to power in 1967, his
Western-trained technocrats put together a liberal macroeconomic programs,
including property rights guarantee and a range of incentives for FDI. However,
during the oil booms of 1970s, the cash-flush government created SOEs in more
sectors while closing them off to FDI. When the oil price crashed in the 1980s,
Indonesia once again invited FDI to diversify its export portfolio away from
oil. Finally, a major reform in June 1994 fully committed Indonesia to FDI
liberalization, removing sectoral barriers and allowing wholly owned
subsidiaries.

While Indonesia eventually opened up, it was both slower and less aggressive
than Malaysia and Thailand in pursuing export-led, high-tech FDI. When the
government designate a sector as ``strategic,'' it was meant to be controlled by
SOEs and not to be targeted for FDI attraction. Even during periods of reform,
Indonesian technocrats shunned using incentives to attract specific types of FDI
and simply removed restrictions from the onerous negative list
\citep[118-124]{Felker2003}.

\section{Data and sample choice}
\label{sec:Japan_sample}

The dataset was compiled by Andrew Delios from the \textit{Kaigai Shinshutsu
  Kigyou Souran} (Japanese Overseas Investments---by Country), 1986-1999
editions.\footnote{I thank Professor Andrew Delios for generously
  sharing the data.} Japanese Overseas Investments is a biennial publication that contains operational data on all foreign affiliates
of Japanese firms, collected by Tokyo Keizai, Inc. via a survey of these
affiliates. The dataset is reputed to include all Japanese firms overseas
\citep{Yamawaki1991}. Comparing the Japanese Overseas Investments data with other
data sources on publicly listed firms, \citet{Delios2001} find that the dataset
covers 98.5\% of public firms, which in turn control 99.5\% of the foreign
subsidiaries. This high level of coverage ensures that our data captures the
entire set of options available to countries and firms, obviating any worry
about whether the choice set in the data represents the choice set in
reality.\footnote{The mismatch between the choice set in the sample and in the
  population is an unexplored theoretical aspect of two-sided matching models.
  Consider an example where we analyze a sample of 1000 men and women in the US
  to estimate their mate preferences. How are our estimates affected by the 
  assumption that each man's potential choice set includes all the women
  (and vice versa)? Not only does an individual not have that many
  acquaintances, his social circle is also not a representative sample of the
  entire dataset \citep[568]{Logan2008}. Fortunately, this is not a problem for
  our application. Given that there are only 9 Asian investment locations and
  approximately 200 Japanese subsidiaries being built each year, we can
  reasonably assume that they are all available to one another as potential
  options.}

From this dataset, I make several choices restricting the sample to better fit
with the assumption of the two-sided matching model.

First, I limit the sample to manufacturing subsidiaries in Asia. This way, it is
more reasonable
for our model to assume
that all subsidiaries have the same set of preference parameters. Indeed,
\citet{Pak2005} find that JFDI in the West and in the East are
fundamentally different---while subsidiaries in the West seek
to augment their asset via R\&D and marketing, subsidiaries in the East seek to exploit their
asset by setting up local production with Japanese superior management. In addition, manufacturing FDI mainly
consists of physical capital in the forms of property, plant, and equipment.
Therefore, our data on the size of subsidiaries' capital maps more precisely to the
concept of illiquid capital subjecting to the ``obsolescing bargain'' in
Political Science theories.

Second, I limit the sample to subsidiaries that are founded in the year 1996. Because the MNCs'
utility function in our model does not capture the fixed cost of relocating, it
would be incorrect to include both subsidiaries that have already invested and
those that are considering, then assume that they have the same set of preference.
Indeed, as a linear combination of only country covariates, the utility function
does not take into account the fact that, if the moving cost is too high, a
subsidiary may not relocate to a new country even if the new country is
available and is a better option.\footnote{Past
applications of the two-sided matching model ignore this point and do not limit
their sample to only agents that participate in the matching market around
the same time \citep{Logan1996, Logan2008}. However, given that a defining
characteristic of FDI is its relative immobility compared to other form of
global capital, if we do not limit our sample, the model's assumption of zero switching cost would be too
unreasonable.}

While the decision to limit the sample to subsidiaries founded in a particular
year is theoretically motivated, the decision to choose the particular year of
1996 is simply to get the largest sample size. There may be concerns about 1996
being unique as the peak of an economic bubble, leading up to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.
However, our sample only includes manufacturing FDI, which, unlike equity
investors and land developers, were largely unaffected by the financial crisis.
In addition, FDI trend remained stable before and after the crisis in terms of
inflow, exit rate, and profitability \citep{Delios2001, UNCTAD1998}. In
hindsight, this is not surprising as FDI firms tend to focus on countries' fundamentals
and are thus unaffected by the fluctuations in the financial markets
\citep{Ahlquist2006}.

In sum, the final sample includes 269 Japanese manufacturing subsidiaries in 1996, spreading
across 9 Asian economies. China is the top destination, attracting 136 or 51\%
of Japanese subsidiaries (Table \ref{tab:japan96_num_obs}).

\begin{table}[tbp]
  \centering
  \caption[Number of Japanese manufacturing subsidiaries founded in 1996, by
  countries.]{Number of Japanese manufacturing subsidiaries founded in 1996, by countries.}
  \label{tab:japan96_num_obs}
  \input{../table/japan96_num_obs}
\end{table}

\section{Variables}
\label{sec:Japan_variables}

For subsidiaries' characteristics that countries consider, I include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Capital size (in real US\$): A main argument for the benefit of FDI is
  that it brings capital to the country, improving labor productivity. MNCs'
  capital is especially important for developing countries, which often cannot
  muster much domestic capital from their poor population and underdeveloped
  financial market. Therefore, we may expect countries to prefer MNCs with a lot
  of capital.

\item Labor size (number of employees): Similarly, a reputed benefit of FDI is
  that it creates jobs, generating not just economic growth but also increasing
  the government's popularity among the populace. Therefore, we may expect
  countries to prefer MNCs with a large labor demand.

\item R\&D intensity (amount spent in R\&D as a percentage of revenue): The
  potential for technological spillover between MNCs' subsidiaries and local
  firms has been touted as a key to upgrading the host economy's productivity. To
  measure a subsidiary's technological capability, I use the R\&D intensity of
  the parent firm, calculated as the amount spent on R\&D as a percentage of
  revenue. Using the parent firm's R\&D intensity is a reasonable proxy because
  JFDI in Asia is mainly asset exploitation, i.e. implementing the
  know-how developed at the parent firm to the production at the subsidiary
  \citep{Pak2005}.\footnote{Another measurement of a firm's intangible asset
    frequently used in the FDI literature is marketing intensity
    \citep{Girma2005}. Here I focus on R\&D intensity because it is the more
    important factor for manufacturing firms.}

\item Export intensity (amount earned via export as a percentage of revenue):
  Scholars have argued that economic growth in Asia is fueled by export and FDI
  as two mutually reinforcing forces \citep{Liu2002}. The subsidiary of an
  export-focused parent firm may help local suppliers become integrated into
  the global production network, improving the quality of their goods to match
  global standards and eventually being able to export themselves. Therefore, we
  may expect countries to actively look for investment from
  Japanese firms with an export focus.
\end{itemize}

For countries' characteristics that MNCs consider, I include the following
variables from the Penn World Table:

\begin{itemize}
\item Market size (log GDP, constant 2005 USD): MNCs are expected to prefer countries with a large market
  size, which present MNCs with many potential customers and suppliers. In
  addition, market size is a key variable in the gravity
  model, a standard model for analyzing FDI \citep{Bergstrand2007}.

\item Level of development (log GDP per capita, constant 2005 USD): As a measure
  of country income, development should attract more MNCs as MNCs prefer
  countries  with
  more disposable income to consume. On the other hand, as a measure of
  countries' capital
  abundance, development should reduce FDI inflow as MNCs' capital is no longer
  a big advantage.

\item Human capital (Penn World Table index): As one primary factor of
  production, labor matters greatly to firms' productivity and profit. To
  measure labor quality, I use the human capital index developed for the Penn World
  Table, which incorporates not just years of education but also the
  productivity level of labor
  \citep{Feenstra2015}. Because the human capital index does not have a
  substantively interpretable unit, I standardize the variable so that it has a
  standard deviation of 1.
\end{itemize}

In sum, the model for the utility functions are:

\begin{itemize}
\item MNC $i$'s utility for country $j$: $U_i(j) = \bm{\alpha}' W_j $, where $W_j$ includes log GDP, log GDP per capita, and human capital index.
\item Country $j$'s utility for MNC $i$: $V_j(i) = \beta_{0j} + \bm{\beta_j}'
  X_i$, where $X_i$ includes log number of employees, log capital size, R\&D intensity, and
export intensity. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Result}
\label{sec:Japan_result}

The results below are produced by an MCMC chain with $4 \times 10^6$ iterations and a
thinning interval of 10, resulting in $4 \times 10^5$ saved iterations. The starting
values for all preference parameters are set at 0. I put a diffuse prior on
$\alpha$, specifically a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 100.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:reservation_choice}, since our sample does not
include MNCs that choose the reservation choice, i.e. staying home instead of
investing abroad, the estimate for the $\beta$ intercept will be too high. To
combat this problem, I use an informative prior so that $\beta_{0j}$
approximately follows a Normal distribution with mean -1 and variance
10.\footnote{Specifically, the prior for $\beta_{0j}$'s mean is Normal with mean
  -1 and variance 1. The prior for $\beta_{0j}$'s variance is Inverse-Wishart
  with $\nu = 7$ and $S^{-1} = 10$ so that the variance is loosely centered
  around 10.}

Figure~\ref{fig:japan96_alpha} shows the posterior distribution and the 95\%
credible interval for MNCs' preference parameters. We can interpret the
parameters as the relative weight MNCs attach to countries' characteristics when
they decide where to invest. For example, the posterior mean for log GDP and for
log GDP per capita is 0.72 and 0.66---this means that to MNCs, a 1\% increase in
GDP is equivalent to 0.72 / 0.66 = 1.09\% increase in GDP per capita.

The coefficient for human capital
is negative, corroborating earlier findings in the literature that Japanese MNCs
in Asia do not aim to be innovative and thus have no need for strong human
capital. On the contrary, since the human capital index includes not only years
of education but also labor productivity, a high human capital index may signify
high labor cost, explaining why Japanese manufacturing MNEs weigh it negatively.

Surprisingly, the coefficients for log GDP and log GDP per capita are both positive and
significant, suggesting that Japanese MNCs are looking for large markets with a
lot of disposable income. Contrary to our expectation of JFDI as
efficiency-seeking, this finding suggests that JFDI in 1996 was looking to enter
Asia's domestic markets. One potential explanation is that, as Southeast Asia
quickly raised its labor cost and expanded its market size, the nature of JFDI
may be changing as well \citep[44]{Jomo2003}.

\begin{figure}[tbp] \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{japan96_alpha}
  \caption[MNCs' preference for countries' characteristics.]{MNCs' preference
    for countries' characteristics. The density plot and the shaded region show
    the posterior distribution and the 95\% credible interval.}
  \label{fig:japan96_alpha}
\end{figure}

In addition to interpreting the coefficients as weights in the MNCs' utility
function, we can also simulate and visualize their impact on MNCs' location
choice. For example, we may ask if country A's GDP increases by 20\%, what will
be the new share of MNCs that invest in country A? Like in the one-sided
conditional logit model, the share of MNCs investing in country A depends not
only on country A's characteristics but also on others'. In addition, in this
two-sided model, the share of MNCs investing in a country also depends on the
preference of countries. For example, even if country A becomes highly
desirable, we may not see much change in the share of MNCs located there if
country A's preference is also highly demanding. The interaction between share
of MNCs and countries' preferences can be much more complicated. Consider a
scenario in which country A and country B have similar preferences and compete
for the same set of MNCs. Even if country A becomes more desirable than the rest
of the countries, as long as country A is less attractive than country B, the
share of MNCs investing in country A will still remain unchanged.

Fortunately, we can easily simulate these effects in the Bayesian framework. For
example, to see how the share of MNCs investing in Thailand changes along with
hypothetical values of Thailand's GDP, we take the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct a scenario in which Thailand has a new GDP, while all other
  characteristics remain for Thailand and other countries
\item Make one draw for each parameter in the model from its posterior
  distribution
\item Simulate the matching process in which countries first make offers to
  MNCs, and MNCs then choose the best option
\item Record the share of MNCs investing in Thailand after the matching process
\item Repeat step (2)-(4) to get a distribution for the share of MNCs in
  Thailand\footnote{Essentially we are constructing the posterior predictive
    distribution for the share of MNCs in Thailand, integrating out the
    preference parameters via simulation.}
\end{enumerate}

Following this process, I calculate the share of Japanese MNCs in Thailand at
different hypothetical values of Thailand's GDP.
Figure~\ref{fig:japan96_effect_GDP_on_share_of_MNCs} shows that as Thailand's
GDP increases from 50\% to 150\% of its true value, the share of MNCs in
Thailand increases from 8\% to 15\%. In addition, the share of MNCs investing in
Indonesia and Malaysia, two competitors of Thailand in ASEAN, declines slightly
as Thailand becomes more attractive. The result suggests that these three
countries tend to attract MNCs from a common pool, and Thailand's gain will be
the others' loss.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{../figure/japan96_effect_GDP_on_share_of_MNCs}
  \caption[Effect of Thailand's GDP on its share of MNCs.]{Effect on Thailand's
    GDP on its share of MNCs. The point and line range show the mean and the
    95\% credible interval.}
  \label{fig:japan96_effect_GDP_on_share_of_MNCs}
\end{figure}

Similar to the interpretation of MNCs' preference parameters, we can also
interpret countries' preference parameters as the relative weight that countries
attach to MNCs' characteristics. Figure~\ref{fig:japan96_beta_Taiwan_Indonesia}
shows that Taiwan wants to attract MNCs that are export-focused and discourage
MNCs that employ a lot of employees. On the other hand, the estimates for
Indonesia's preference parameters are not statistically significant, perhaps due
to our small sample size.\footnote{I present the results for Taiwan and
  Indonesia here because they are two countries highly desired by MNCs. As
  discussed in Section~\ref{sec:reservation_choice}, the estimate for highly
  desirable countries are more accurate.}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{../figure/japan96_beta_Taiwan_Indonesia}
  \caption[Preference of Taiwan and Indonesia.]{Preference of Taiwan and
    Indonesia for MNCs' characteristics.}
  \label{fig:japan96_beta_Taiwan_Indonesia}
\end{figure}

While the relative size of preference parameters within a country is meaningful,
we cannot readily compare preference parameters across countries. This is
because coefficients in the logit model is normalized so that the variance of
the unobserved factors in the utility function becomes 1. Therefore, the
relative size of coefficients across two countries may be affected by the
relative variance of the unobserved factors in the utility functions of those
two countries \citep[chap. 2]{Train2009}. Since there is no guarantee that the
unobserved factors will be the same or have the same variance across countries,
we cannot say that, for example, Taiwan values export intensity more than
Vietnam because Taiwan's coefficient for export intensity is larger.

We can, however, look at the sign of the estimates to see whether countries
evaluate an MNC's trait positively or negatively.
Figure~\ref{fig:japan96_beta_ltemp_luscptl} and
Figure~\ref{fig:japan96_beta_intrd_intexp} show countries' preference for labor
size, capital size, R\&D intensity, and export intensity. Most countries seem to
dislike subsidiaries with a large labor force---this finding meets our
expectation that high-growth East Asian (Korea, Taiwan) and Southeast Asian
(Malaysia, Thailand) were steering away from labor-intensive manufacturing in
the 1990s. In addition, several countries including Taiwan, Malaysia, and
Thailand, seem to prefer subsidiaries that focus on export. This finding affirms
our understanding of these economies as being export-driven.

\begin{figure}[tbp] \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{japan96_beta_ltemp_luscptl}
  \caption[Countries' preference for subsidiaries' size.]{Countries' preference
    for subsidiaries' size, measured by their labor force (left) and capital
    (right). The density plot and the shaded region show the posterior
    distribution and the 95\% credible interval.}

\end{figure}

    posterior distribution and the 95\% credible interval.}
  \label{fig:japan96_beta_intrd_intexp}
\end{figure}

In addition, we can simulate and visualize the impact of countries' preference
on MNCs' location choice. Using the steps described above to simulate the
posterior predictive distribution,
Figure~\ref{fig:japan96_sim_china_more_demanding} shows how the distribution of
Japanese MNCs across Asian countries will change if China becomes more stringent
in its evaluation of MNCs. As China becomes as picky as South Korea (i.e.
China's intercept is decreased to match South Korea's on average), the share of MNCs
located in China decreases from 47\% to 20\%, a change of 27 percentage
points. Of these 27 percentage points, 20 go to Indonesia and Thailand, the two
biggest beneficiaries of China's reduced appetite for FDI. On the other hand, the
share of MNCs in Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan remains virtually unchanged,
suggesting that China is not competing for the same MNCs as these countries.

    Thailand.}

\section{Model fit}
\label{sec:model_fit}

To check that our model fits well to the data, we can conduct posterior
predictive checks, generating simulated matchings and comparing them with observed
matching.

Since the location of MNCs is something we model directly, we at least
expect our model to have a good fit with the observed location.
Figure~\ref{fig:japan96_prob_being_chosen_by_MNC_two_sided} shows that our model
performs well in this regard---the predicted share of MNCs across countries
match the observed share exactly in most cases and well within the 95\% credible
interval for all cases. 

\begin{figure}[!ht] \centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{japan96_prob_being_chosen_by_MNC_two_sided}
  \caption[Predicted and observed MNCs' distribution across Asia.]{Predicted and
    observed share of MNCs across countries. The point and the error
bar show the posterior mean and the 95\% credible interval.}
  \label{fig:japan96_prob_being_chosen_by_MNC_two_sided}
\end{figure}

In addition, by conducting the posterior predictive checks for aspects of the
data that we do not model directly, we gain a deeper understanding into what
part of reality our model does not capture. Since we may be interested in
not only the share of MNCs across countries, but also which types of firms are
located in which countries, I conduct the posterior predictive checks for MNCs'
characteristics across countries. Figure~\ref{fig:japan96_sim_mean_ltemp} and
Figure~\ref{fig:japan96_sim_var_ltemp} show that our model captures the mean
and the variance of of MNCs' size across countries relatively well, with the
observed mean and variance of log Employee lying within the 95\% interval for all cases.
Admittedly the 95\% interval is really wide for many countries, reflecting the
lack of precision in the estimates for countries' preference, likely due to the
small sample size.
