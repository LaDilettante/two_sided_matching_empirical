\chapter{Simulation results}
\label{chap:simulation}

This chapter shows simulation results to compare the use of the TSL model
against more naive approaches to the matching problems.

Table for the values underlying the simulation results

Table / Graph showing the result of the TSL vs one sided logit

Simulate a change in one side leading to a wrong estimate of the other side
- Logan shows the change in the demand (i.e. the demand intercept)
- Maybe I could show the change in the preference for characteristics?
- This kind of simulation can be done again for FDI later

Discuss the effect of having offers that are different across respondents

Discuss the correlation of MCMC

Discuss the adaptive procedure that I attempted but failed
